文字 // Justin Voitic攝影 // Kuna Lu | Kuna Photography GroupOn Thursday August 18th 2016, those invited to join Vancouver’s Diner en Blanc celebrated it’s 5th anniversary in such a glamorous way. The largest one yet, totalling over 6000 people with 2000 more than previous years.One third of the stylish attendees were Le Diner en Blanc first time participants, joining the veterans as we all enjoyed a magical evening together!I (Justin Voitic) attended with my fave photographer Kuna Photography Group and were impressed as always not only by the effort those had put into their elegant all white looks, but by the extravagance of the table displays created but attendees who set up their own tables, linens and decorations as they dine al fresco.The Vancouver Circus School is always a stand out with their talented contortionists who showed off their gymnastic strength in these photos, sprayed in beautiful white and silver body paint and shimmery makeup artistry to suit the event.The incomparable Dani Barnes / House Of Barnes styled Crystal Carson and myself this year in looks by Boo La La Costumes.Crystal Carson the Style Director was a whimsical vision in white with a lace bustle, LED lights which took the dress day to night, an amazing fascinator and jewelry by the iconic Carolyn Bruce who creates incredible Steam-Punk jewelry.Our friends at Moet & Chandon hooked me up with a limited edition fan, which I had fun flapping as I felt it went well with my white feather plumed top hat and pearls which Dani Barnes had picked out for me.Thanks to Craig and the team inside the Media lounge for making our experience to entertaining, inside the Concord Pacific building which was air-conditioned and a nice breather to regroup as we sipped on delicious Rose before heading out again to continue our coverage.The climax was the memorable tradition of lighting the night aglow with sparklers, as everyone soaked up the experience and celebrated with new and old friends while Juno nominated band The Lost Fingers serenaded us to cap off the 5th year of Le Diner en Blanc- VancouverWe then head over to the after party to continue to dance the night away, as always we couldn’t shake off the after glow of a blissful and unforgettable evening.Shout out to The Social Concierge & Camber Communications for inviting us and rocking the event increasingly every year! 官網原文
