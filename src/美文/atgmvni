时光太瘦，指缝太宽......时光荏苒，2016悄然已逝，回首整整一年，用一个字来概括"忆"。Time is too thin, the fingers are too wide.....Time was fly, 2016 passed quietly, recall the whole year, summary as one word "memory".-婚姻  Marriage20+年前虽相知不多，但心有灵犀，让你我走到了一起。于1996故乡的冬天步入婚姻殿堂。转眼间一年，双胞胎儿女降临，有苦有乐，但无怨无悔。过去的20年，你使我快乐，偶然难过......我们一起面对一切。时间磨平了我们的棱角，虽已不再年轻，心历沧桑，但你我都更为成熟睿智。如今已然明白了生活中的苦乐、真谛与奇妙，我们依然相濡以沫，携手同行。未来的20年，希望你我仍然是彼此最在意的人，多一点理解，耐心。We didn’t know much about each other twenty+ years ago. We were guided by our intuition and stepped in together.It was the winter of 1996 when we got married at the hometown. One year passed, twins came, good times, hard times, but never bad times.The passed twenty years, you made me happy、sad occasionally......We faced everything together.Time smoothed the angle of us, we are not so younger, wiser-with wrinkles on our faces and hearts.We now know many of life’s joys, sufferings, secrets and wonders and we’re still here together.The next twenty years, I hope we still are the important persons for each other and pay more understanding and more patience.-友情  Friendship那时我们稚嫩过，奋斗过，幻想过......那时我们没有手机，网络，微信......生活让我们各奔东西，岁月让我们成熟，感谢科技让我们重逢于微信平台，回忆过去，调侃生活,了解彼此......一路有你92.8！今年的最大收获就是找回丢失了大约1/4个世纪的小伙伴们，同学的那份情感是在现在的工作环境里无法体会的，沉淀了多年的思绪也被唤回到那个时代的初心。生活允许我们在不成熟时犯错误，甚至丢失很多重要的人和事，但更多的是给予我们在成长过程中找回自我的机会。We were young, fighted, dreamed......We haven't phone, network, wechat......Life made us separated everywhere,Time made us wiser,Technical made us meet again at the platform of wechat , memory, chat the life, understanding the current status of each other.......Always be with you 92.8！The biggest gain was looked back the little partners who lost about 1/4 century. This feeling can't taste in the current work environment. The original mood be recalled to the 1/4 century ago.The life allowed us to make mistakes even lost something and person important when we was young, but give us more opportunities to look back ourselves when we grow up.-工作  Job面临每天工作挑战的同时，我们不仅要怀着喜悦迎接人生的牛市，更要有良好的心态应对人生的熊市。人生不可能一帆风顺的像条上扬的直线，每个人都会在漫长的人生道路上碰壁，遇到瓶颈，在曲线的每一个拐弯处，构成了我们富有弹性的曲线人生。每个人的人生都有两条路，一条用心走，叫做梦想；一条用脚走，叫做现实。如果心走得太慢，现实就会苍白；而如果脚走得太慢，梦想就不会高飞。人生的精彩，莫过于心走得很美，且与脚步合一。We need to face the challenges everyday, at the same time, we not only need to face the bull market with right moods, but also need to face the bear market with health attitudes for the life. It is impossible a good trend for our life always. We must face the walls and the bottlenecks. at the conner of the trend to make the elastic life for ourselves.The are 2 ways for our life, one is dream and walked by heart; one is actual and walked by feet. The actual will be pale if the heart is too slow; The dream will not fly as possible as you want if the foot is too slow. The wonderful of the life should be to make sure the heart and foot as one level.-生活 Life将工作和生活分开，做一些自己真正有兴趣的事情，更多的走出家门，让运动和接触大自然成为一种习惯, 用镜头记录生活点点滴滴。本想把日子过成诗，时而简单，时而精致。不料日子却过成了我的歌，时而不靠谱，时而不着调。Made the work and life separately, did something that I was interested, Not waste more time stay at home, let sports and close to the natural become to my habit. Record the life drips and drabs by camera.Make the life like poetry, sometimes simple, sometimes exquisite. But the days have become to my song, sometimes not reliable, sometimes not on tune.-感恩2016一路有你感恩亲人、同事、朋友......出现在我生命里所有的人。感谢你们的耐心、理解、合作、支持、帮助......让我的2016充实、快乐并不断成长！时刻的美好回忆，再次感谢大家！-Thanks be all with you 2016!Thanks for my family, colleagues , friends...... all the persons who appeared in my life. Thanks for your patience, understanding, corporation, support, help...... Let me have a substantial, happy and grow up continually in 2016 !It was a good memory for every moment, thanks all of you again!-Welcome 2017......沉淀生命，沉淀经验，沉淀心情，沉淀自己！Accumulate the life,Accumulate the experience,Accumulate the mood, Accumulate myself !文章：叶子出镜：叶子地点：湛江.东海岛/家.阳台/佛山.清晖园/公司/茂德公草堂时间：2016夏器材：iphone 6 （月亮：手机+望远镜）*************************************************************附YESTERDAY ONCE MORE 昨日重现When I was young 当我小的时候 I'd listen to the radio 我聆听收音机Waitin' for my favorite songs 等待着心爱的歌曲When they played I'd sing along 合着旋律清唱 It made me smile.笑容满面Those were such happy times 那是多么幸福的时光 And not so long ago 并不遥远 How I wondered where they'd gone 可我却不知道它们到哪去了 But they're back again 但它们又回来了Just like a long lost friend 像久无音信的朋友 All the songs I loved so well. 所有我那么爱过的歌曲Every Sha-la-la-la 每一个Sha-la-la-la Every Wo-o-wo-o 每一个Wo-o-wo-oStill shines 依然闪亮Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 他们开始唱的 That they're startin' to sing's 每一个shing-a-ling-a-ling So fine. 如此悦耳 When they get to the part 当他们唱到 Where he's breakin' her heart 他让她伤心的那一段 It can really make me cry 真的让我哭泣 Just like before 像从前一样 It's yesterday once more. 昔日又重来 Lookin' back on how it was 回首过去的 In years gone by 那些时光 And the good times that I had 我曾有过的欢乐 Makes today seem rather sad 使今天更加伤感 So much has changed. 太多的改变 It was songs of love that 只有那些跟着唱过的 I would sing to then 旧情歌 And I'd memorize each word 我还记得每一个字 Those old melodies 那些旧旋律 Still sound so good to me 仍然那么动听 As they melt the years away. 可以把岁月融化 Every Sha-la-la-la 每一个Sha-la-la-la Every Wo-o-wo-o 每一个Wo-o-wo-o Still shines 依然闪亮 Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 他们开始唱的 That they're startin' to sing's 每一个shing-a-ling-a-ling So fine. 如此悦耳 All my best memories 所有我最美好的回忆 Come back clearly to me 清晰地浮现眼前 Some can even make me cry. 有些甚至让我泪流满面 Just like before 就像从前一样 It's yesterday once more. 昔日又重来END
