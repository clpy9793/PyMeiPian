《百年孤独》以南美洲19世纪末到二十世纪几个大历史事件为背景，描写了Buendia 一家（我们以后叫她布恩迪亚家族）七代的兴衰。《百年孤独》 是1982 年若贝尔文学得奖者，南美洲哥伦比亚作家加西亚马尔克斯的代表作。西班牙原作发表于1967年，轰动了整个南美.1970 被Gregory Rabassa 翻译成英文风靡了全世界，因此得到若贝尔奖。Gregory Rabassa 是最优秀的西班牙文学英语翻译家。Garcia 耐心排队，等了他三年才得到他的翻译。成书后，Garcia 多次宣称英文版的比自己的西班牙原版更好。文学评论界也公认，英文版的语气忠实原味，文字优美动人。 哥伦比亚在十六世纪之前时indian人居住的地方，十六世纪到十九时是西班牙帝国的殖民地，十九世纪独立后，多次的分合，最后成了哥伦比亚共和国， 由保守党和自由党人轮流治执政， 有过多次和多年的国内战争，还有革命武装力量以及毒枭的骚乱。 加西亚马尔克斯1927年出生在哥伦比亚加勒比海岸边的一个小镇 Aracataca，在内地受教育， 学习pre-law，却成了记者专栏作家和评论家。成名前生活跌宕起伏，四处漂泊。去过巴黎，罗马，伦敦，东德，捷克，苏联。后来回到南半球，在Venezuela 差点被逮，在哈瓦那加盟了左派出版社， 又逃到纽约，天天受到反对红色古巴的难民骚扰。 当他工作的出版社被铁腕共产主义政权取缔后， 他只好回到墨西哥城。在他回去之前，特别去了美国作家威廉·福克納《喧嘩與騷動》（The Sound and the Fury－William Faulkner） 所描写的破落的南方看看。 他是坐灰狗巴士去的， 他觉得窗前闪过的景象就是威廉描写Jefferson  or Yoknapatawpha County。 这或许就是他创作《百年孤独》和Macondo 的灵感。 在墨西哥居住期间，他被一位出版代理人发现，并签下了让其以$1000代理出版已经完成的四部小说， 同时$5000美金代理出版他的下一本书， 那就是当时还没有影子，之后轰动世界的《百年孤独》。 18个月孤独的写作， Garcia消耗掉3000 包烟， 家里的钱都花光了， 老婆变卖值钱的东西度日， 最后书成后连邮费都不够，只好分批寄出。从此，西班牙文学中出了第二本"唐 吉戈德"一样伟大的文学作品 （真的， 他描写的Macondo 的吉普赛集市情景真的让我联想起那位哈佛学子Quintin自杀前的回忆家乡的情景（ Of the bleak station and mud and the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the square, with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out ） 还有，Fernanda 的没落贵族的虚荣傲慢幻觉和自怜自卑和Mrs. Compson 的南方贵族的虚荣和自怜自卑也有异曲同工之处） 英文版的小说可以在网上轻松搜到： One Hundred Years of Solitude By Gabriel Garcia Marqueze - Laureate of Nobel PricePublished in Spanish 1967Translated into English by Gregory Rabassa 1970 中文版的《百年孤独》有多种译本， 大家也可以到网上很容易的搜索到。  我个人是在IBook 上读了Gregory Rabassa 的英文版， 刚读了几段就不能释手，竟自闭孤独了数日，直到读完为止。主要是被他的细节写法和结构布局迷住，最爱开篇第一句。于是拙摩，写出自己的最深感受。愿和各位书友交流分享。 读后感和断代笔记是先有英文才有中文。因为书读的是英文版，笔记用英文比较方便。中文版是因为要和朋友们交流后来写的，靠记忆和英文版笔记。中英版可能都有错， 欢迎指出，讨论。 断代笔记中的一世二世三世等等，指的是一代二代三代等等在英文里则用1G，2G， 3G 缩写。     多年以后，当她读完《百年孤独》， Lynn准会想起那个遥远的下午，她的父亲对她能读完《红楼梦》无比震惊的表情。 那时候，文化大革命正当高潮， 袭卷了中国大地。所有的学校停课，包括小学甚至幼儿园；所有的书除了红色书籍都是禁书，更别说古书洋书了。偷读《红楼梦》那是罪孽，特别是一个小女孩，她怎么可能抵挡的了封建文化的流毒呢？      "你怎么会读起这大人书呢？你怎么可能认识书中的字呢？" 父亲的语气藏不住惊喜和赞许。 后来，这惊喜和赞许就成了LYNN 啃读难书的内在动力。      "一本字典和一个好的记忆， 您不是说过？" Lynn还是孩子气地，心不在焉地回答，心中对父亲的惊讶感到疑惑。 自从学校关门，家里的大多数书也都被抄家没收后，她便开始了坎坎坷坷的自学道路，读任何她可以找到的书页，就靠着一本字典， 一颗好奇而孤独的童心。《红楼梦》藏在家壁橱里的一个隐套壁橱里，没被发现，里面还有一些别的书。      "再说呢， 这也不是那么难懂的书，不过是一块有灵性的石头和一株还情仙草的人世遭遇，主人翁都不过十二，三岁，也没大我多少，  为什么是大人书呢？"      多年以后， 不知读过多少次《红楼梦》，LYNN才理解了父亲的惊讶和《红楼梦》的深广。而每一次阅读，她都要为繁花红楼最后只落了片白茫茫大地真干净的结局，悲催流泪。一个"空"字，梦断人间情缘。       也是相似的一个冬天的下午， 当《百年孤独》IBOOK 漆黑黑的屏幕上只剩下孤零零的两个大写斜体字 "THE END", LYNN呆住了，她只能静静旳幻视着天上的落霞在风中飞舞，仿佛Macondo 马孔多和 Buendia 布恩迪亚家族在那一瞬间被飓风袭卷到天上，只落了片白茫茫大地真干净；仿佛几百页的生与死， 爱与恨， 穷与富， 孤独与喧哗， 怀旧与遗忘，失眠与沉睡，战争与和平， 保守党与自由党， 文学与科学都燃烧在夕阳落霞里，因为那被诅咒一定要遭受百年孤独的家族，注定不可能在地球上第二次出现。漫天的落霞飞舞燃烧，渐渐地演变成一个大写的单词：  孤独     "孤独"写满了全书，少年的孤独，老来的孤独，处女的孤独， 美女的孤独，死前的孤独，恐惧的孤独，可恨的孤独，认命的孤独，渴望的孤独，选择的孤独，自闭的孤独……等等。孤独是全书的主题，就像书名所提示的，也是LYNN读书时感受最深的。自从Jose Arcadio Buendia 侯赛 阿卡迪 布恩迪亚在这个孤岛的一条清水河边建起了Macondo马孔多镇，这个西班牙裔家族就深陷在这个虚构的乌托邦小镇里， 不管他们走多远，到了哪里；不管他们有多么荣耀，多么落魄；如何挣扎，如何逃避；最终都会像孤魂一样回到Macondo马孔多，死在Macondo马孔多。        是的，正是一种被诅咒的，不可渗透的孤独，使得这个家族几代传承了近亲乱伦爱恋的孽僻和无可救药的自溺自闭自恋自衍： 第一代的亲表结婚，第二代的兄弟同睡一个女人，姐妹争爱同一个男人，第三代的母恋姑恋，第四代自溺自怜，重复了兄弟同睡一个女人的情结，第五代的自暴自弃，重复了不可自拔的暗恋姑姥的悲剧，第六代和第五代的姨甥婚恋，恋断了Buendia 家族，最后生出了长着猪尾巴的婴儿，被红蚂蚁吃了。在这个家族里，人人孤独得能和鬼魂相处相敬，甚至像鬼魂一样在失忆或者怀旧中隐居自闭，活着死去。连他们的名字都局限在几个字中，男的不是Jose ，Arcadio ， 就是 Aureliano；女的也只是Ursula, Amaranta, Remedios. 自溺自怜，自闭自私，自暴自弃，自恋自衍最终导致这个家族自毁自灭。     《百年孤独》是一曲人间悲歌。她的抒情音符，不仅吟咏了凋谢的美丽，失败的英雄，注定的厄运，和破碎了的乌托邦，而且唱绝了大于哥伦比亚，大于拉丁美州的人类悲哀：虚伪混乱的自由党与保守党的政治斗争，盲从健忘的愚民大众，空虚无为的国内战争，腐败的政府，自欺欺人的集团宗教，自私排外的西班牙殖民主义者，贪婪而改变地球环境的外来资本，还有大屠杀后灭尸毁证篡改历史…这些种种孽事直到今天还在地球不断地发生着。这样深刻犀利的主题内容被作者很技巧地艺术化在魔幻现实主义和意识流的表现形式, 以及前半部多预言，后半部多怀旧的精妙，而自然的小说结构里。就像书中委婉凄美而回味无穷的开篇： Many years later when faced the fire squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember in that distance afternoon his father took him to discover ice.多年以后，当他面向刑队，奥雷连诺准会想起那个遥远的下午， 他的父亲带他去"发现冰"。       这第一唱，唱遍了过去，现在和将来， 唱出了书中两位悲剧主角，唱出了临死的悲哀，唱出了神秘的平常，平常的神秘， 也唱进了 LYNN的心里，使她不由自主地拙摹开篇，写下此文。 这样的句子成为全书韵律而不断回环反复。 单单"多年以后"，就在书中出现二十多次， 还不算多月以后，多周以后，多时以后。书中写了没完没了的死， 疯死，战死，老死，猝死，溺死，病死，神秘死， 安详死， 羽化死，血尽而死；面对刑队，被枪决而死只是其中残酷而无奈的一种，但放在第一句，立刻就把悲哀传给了读者。 书中写了无穷无尽的魔幻化家常或者家常魔幻化的情景，比如，生活在19世纪末的Arcadio 一世疯疯癫癫玩多时的航海仪器，终于发现地球是圆的，像橘子一样。吉普赛先知的起死回生，第二代的阿卡迪把对吉普赛先知印象传给后辈子，第四代的嫉世美女的升天而去，等等… "发现冰"只是其中一事，而放在第一句，立刻就模糊了读者原定的现实和幻想的界线。冰块，这自然形成，并已存在了几万年的寻常物质，竟然被当成神秘的魔物在Macondo马孔多镇展出赚钱。我们的探险家兼科学发明家第一代的Jose Arcadio Buendia 竟然误以为那是世界上最大的钻石， 被纠正后还庄严地宣布，"这是我们这个时代最伟大的发明"。选择第一句就"发现冰"似乎很随意，但也许很刻意。Macondo马孔多镇就是因为这位探险家梦见了一个迷一样的镜墙之屋的城镇而建起来的，"发现冰"之后，这位探险家兼幻想家参透了镜墙其实就是冰墙，而冰屋建起的城镇是必将化为无有的，书的结局就这样隐喻在书的第一句。       慢点，这样的解析是不是有点牵强附会呢？然而正是这些纤细的，是似而非而有充满寓意的家常，看似随意而又刻意地融化在"过去现在将来同时存在"的时间平面里，才使这本书咋看混乱难懂，再读回味无穷且流畅顺当，使书中的人物个个栩栩如生，如真如幻，如你如我，如神如鬼， 即便是随风飘去，在地球上不复存在，也能永垂不朽。就好像《红楼梦》的贾宝玉遁入空门，落了片白茫茫大地真干净，而真作假，假作真的红楼梦却从来没断过一样。        百年孤独，一曲悲歌，唱断人间最哀。      03/23/2017《百年孤独》以南美洲19世纪末到二十世纪几个大历史事件为背景，描写了Buendia 一家（我们以后叫她布恩迪亚家族）七代的兴衰。 第一代是传奇创史也是原罪的一代。 这是Macondo 镇（ 我们以后叫她马孔多镇）的创世纪时期，也是马孔多镇的世外桃源或者乌托邦那样美好和谐时代，虽然并不是很富裕。 大概象征着西班牙开拓者刚刚征服南美的殖民时期.  人物 Jose Arcadia Buendia 侯赛 阿卡迪一世。    妻子 Usula 乌苏拉 霍塞 阿卡迪和乌苏菈是堂表兄妹， 结婚时被警告可能会象他们的姑叔近亲结婚一样生下长猪尾巴的孩子。Ursula乌苏拉为此担忧了一辈子。 新婚期， 她拒绝和丈夫同床，使得丈夫成了村里人的笑柄。一次斗鸡中，丈夫受到失败者的讥笑，于是在决斗中杀死了对手。 死人成了鬼，夫妻不堪贵的纠缠和自己良心的谴责。于是离乡背井，开始传奇的开拓，寻觅新的天地。跟随的还有村里的一些年轻人。 经过一年多的跋涉， 有一天，阿卡迪在一条清河边梦见了一个叫Macondo马孔多 有着反光墙房屋的村子， 醒来便在河岸上建立了这个叫Macondo 马孔多的乌托邦小镇。小镇与世隔绝，自我管理，自得其乐。每年三月吉普赛人都要来访， 这是他们唯一和外界联系的时候。吉普赛人总能带来许多魔术和新发明，比如磁铁，放大镜，假牙套， 炼金术等。阿卡迪一世开始为小镇的闭塞隔世感到忧虑，于是带着年轻人继续寻找小镇与外界的通路， 结果却发现，小镇四面环水，注定要与世隔绝。 阿卡迪和吉普赛先知Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯结成好友。其为他建立一个实验室。从此这个马孔多小镇的开山鼻祖，便开始沉迷于科学发明，幻想发明永动机，辐射武器等。 有一年的展会上， 他带着两个儿子去看热闹，却听到好友Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯已经溺水而亡在新加坡的深海里， 失落中他偶然"发现"了被吉普赛人当做奇宝的冰块，他以为那是全世界最大的钻石， 被告知不是后， 就庄严底宣布， "这是我们这个时代最伟大的发明"。  让阿卡迪一世解开了创镇梦中的谜，那镜墙屋的村子， 其实是冰屋村。将来有一天，他将要造冰厂，把马孔多变成冰房之镇，让镇里的人不受闷热气候之苦。他只能幻想着，因为此时他必须用时间来教育的儿子们。 他的妻子乌苏拉是个精神百倍，任劳任怨，脚踏实地，一生没有哼唱过的女人。她为布文迪雅家生了两男一女并收养了一个女孩，她主理家事，开面包店和糖果店，让家里殷实富裕，并换新家园，使Buendia布恩迪雅家的楼房成为全村最好最气派也最好客的大宅院。这时候保守派政府却介入了这个乌托邦小镇， 镇长让乌苏拉的房子漆成蓝色， 因为蓝色代表保守派，而红色代表自由党。阿卡迪带人把政府派来的镇长教训了一顿，便让妻子乌苏拉把房子漆成白色。（这是这个家族第一次反抗保守政府） 不幸的是，Buendia布恩迪雅家收养的女孩带来了会传染，并且会引起失忆的失眠症。 正当整个村陷入失眠失忆绝望时， 吉普赛先知Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯不甘死亡的孤独寂寞，再次回生来到马孔多镇， 用一瓶蓝药水治愈了全村的失眠症。从此他在Buendia布恩迪亚家永驻， 还给马孔多镇带来的照相术，并且用梵文隐意诗歌的形式预写了Buendia布恩迪亚家族和马孔多镇一百多年后的命运和历史。Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯的第二次死亡，引发了Macondo马孔多镇的第一个葬礼，并因此建起了坟场。 但是， 马孔多镇的开山鼻祖阿卡迪一世却又开始沉迷于创造"时间机器"， 最终迷失发疯在时间隧道里，因为他身形健硕力大无比，人们只好把他绑在Bundia布恩迪亚院子里的大树上，任风吹日晒，任他自喃疯语。因为有了坟场，死鬼们就能沟通了。阿卡迪一世之前杀死的冤魂找来了Macondo马孔多镇，并和Arcadio阿卡迪一世重修和好，日日对话，相缠相扰。阿卡迪一世死的时候，漫天下着细细小小的黄花雨。 （ 他的悲剧结局是不是隐喻"世界是不可知"？ 就像书里写的，吉普赛先知Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯的部落因为懂得太多了，所以被消失了, 书在最后回答了这个问题， 不是不可知， 是时间未到） 大概近百年以后，他的妻子乌苏拉才死去。死前她双目失明，却对家里的事明察洞观。但也不免挣扎在老来孤独无人能解中，最后干缩如婴儿般。 她死之前，青豆掉在地上会自行组成漂亮的几何图形。她被埋葬在篮子一样大的小棺材里，村里没有什么人来追悼，只有漫天热得无法忍受的鸟儿不停地栽进人屋自杀。 乌苏拉活了超过122岁，拉扯大了Buendia布恩迪亚家族的五代后辈，几乎经历Macondo马孔多镇的整个兴衰。 虽然似乎总是后代人生活的配角，但却是整本书的女主角。她的思路和插话常常准确而精彩地总结注释了Buendia 布恩迪亚家族人的性格行为，还有Macondo马孔多镇的事件变迁。 （   第二代的布恩迪亚家族，如果说不上是传奇的一代，那也是英雄一世。 他们经历的苦难而空虚的内战，用武力参与了保守党和自由党的理念之争 。除了老大阿卡迪二世，另外兄弟姐妹仨都长寿。 阿卡迪二世继承了他父亲健硕的身材和冲动的性格，却没有他父亲的深邃洞察和想象力。他少年时便被发现长者过人雄伟的男性器官，被会用扑克牌算命的女帮工Pilar Ternera （以后叫她皮菈 ）勾引上床，并令其怀孕。可是后来却冲动地爱上了一个吉普赛姑娘，随其部落而去。 经历65次的环球航海后，带着满身蓝红刺纹和巨人般健硕的身材和胃口回到了这个闭塞的家乡。他在村里不误正业，与男人比扳手，让女人们争操，最终被领养的妹妹收复，与其结婚，但却被大怒的母亲赶出家门。 这对离经叛道的夫妻从此索居在坟场边的屋子里。他在魅力和精力无穷的妻子的相导下成了勤劳的猎手和农民，占领了无数的农庄山地。他还勇士般地救下了面对刑队就要被枪决的弟弟Colonel Aureliano奥雷连若二世。但是他却神秘的血尽而亡。他的血一直从他在坟场的卧房里，流过小镇的街道，穿过布恩迪亚大院亭台，来到厨房里正在做饭的母亲的脚下。他身上没有枪伤，家里没有凶器，可是身上的抢火味却浓烈出奇，无论家人如何洗刷甚至烹煮他的尸体都无法去味。这气味一直弥漫久远，直到多年以后，美国的香蕉公司在此建厂铺上水泥。 阿卡迪二世的妻子Rebeca从此隐居直到老死。她是布恩迪亚亲戚和养女，来的时候，瘦小病态，只带着咚咚相碰作响的父母骨头的布袋，还有吃泥土的怪癖。后来出落成楚楚动人却缺乏耐性的美女。少女时和一位意大利音乐器材商人相爱，却遭到同时爱上这位男人的小表妹Amaranta的强烈妒忌, 并积怨终身。她和意大利人的婚期受到百般阻扰，才使她和终身所爱的哥哥私奔成婚。 第二个儿子Aureliano继承了父亲的丰富想象力和深邃内向孤独的性格，还有母亲的洞察和理性。他在母胎里哭泣，生出来时张着明亮尖锐的眼睛四处探索。他还有预知自己死亡和有些将要发生的事情的特异功能。他身材瘦削精干，少年时沉浸在父亲的实验室里用银子造小艺术品。后来爱上了一个白皮肤绿眼睛的小美女Remedios。小美女是保守党镇长的最小女儿， 简直可以当他的女儿。可是他执着地爱着，并找曾经和哥哥睡过的用扑克算命女人皮菈发泄性欲解除痛苦。 皮菈帮他沟通，小姑娘竟愿意嫁他。可是父亲阿卡迪一世开始不让儿子和自己的敌人成婚，扭不过母亲乌苏拉对小姑娘的一腔钟爱－乌苏拉认为这家女儿都是勤劳端庄的淑女。阿卡迪一世上门代儿子求婚，这才发现小姑娘还没有发育呢。可是他耐心等着，并诗情喷薄，成天咏颂美丽的小姑娘。成婚后。这个美丽淑女果真给布恩迪亚家园带来了久违的欢乐，她处世大方无私周到，大家都喜欢她。可是好景不长，俏媳妇突然感冒被自己的血毒死了，肚子里还横着一对双胞胎。年轻沉默的Aureliano奥雷连若每天仍然到镇长岳父家下象棋，无意中发现了保守党政府官员们竟然在选举时作弊偷换选票，他开始倾向自由党。后来到保守党官兵在镇上的残暴枪杀被疯狗咬的女人， 最终和镇的年轻朋友发起暴动，加入自由党部队，开始了他为自由党而战的戎马生涯。他发动32次战争，足迹遍布哥伦比亚和加勒比海，幻想成立加勒比自由联邦，最终成为自由党起义部队的总司令。他日益荣耀，日益孤独。当他变成自己所痛恨军事独裁者，权利到达巅峰时，他的心却沉落到孤独空虚的最底层。他认清了政治的虚伪，内战的空虚， 而自己竟然是位荣耀而战时，他颓然沮丧， 满满地放下虚荣，签字休战，回到马孔多镇，过上了孤独自闭的生活。他拒绝政府给他的任何荣耀，有时发发无碍的余威。但是政府却派人暗杀了他战时生下的十七个儿子。从此，他只有在布恩迪亚家族的实验室里反复制作银质小金鱼，每批十七条，制成后化了，化了再制，循环往复，直到失忆老死在捆绑他父亲的大树下。       他的敏锐的母亲发现这个儿子其实生来就没有爱的能力，他没有真正爱过任何女人，不用说战争中送上来的女人，就连家里用长明灯供拜着的女神，他的小媳妇，都没有真爱过，那只是痴迷而已， 他根本就是一个自私自闭的孤魂。 (他烧掉自己的诗歌，是不是象征着浪漫诗情其实无用，不能长存？落败英雄的最后失忆,  寓意着战争的空虚，为什么被他母亲骂成无情无义？  他最后悟出，一切荣华权力不如简单孤寂不是挺好？) 第三代是生长在战争中不幸夭折的一代， 全部都是私生子。 其中一个战争儿子，建立铁路，把二十世纪的摩登带到闭塞落后的马孔多镇同时，也带来贪婪的外国资本，永远改变了马孔多镇。  阿卡迪三世是阿卡迪二世和算命女人的私生子。他在缺乏爱的家庭氛围里成长，不知道自己的母亲是谁。他是个坚定的自由党者，他的叔叔奥雷连若上校第一次起义后就把马孔多镇交给了他。于是他成了马孔多镇历史上最残酷无理的暴力独裁者， 他滥杀无辜，挪用公款。并强行要和算命女人皮菈－他的母亲做爱， 吓坏了皮菈，但也被老辣的皮菈敷衍而过，安排了美丽的处女珊塔索非亚和他睡觉。他的行为让祖母乌苏拉痛心不已，又一次竟然当街鞭抽这个独裁者。他恨死了布恩迪亚。自由党在第一次战争中失败后， 马孔多镇落到保守党之手，阿卡蒂三世也被枪决了，临死前高呼自由党万岁， 并发现自己最恨原来是自己最爱的人。他的遗嘱是，把他的六个月的女儿命名为乌苏拉，遗腹子命名为阿卡迪以铭记自己的祖父祖母。 奥雷连若三世是奥雷连若上校二世和算命女人的私生子。和他的堂哥不同，他知道自己的身份，小时候和父亲一样喜欢在实验室里埋头苦干，少年时迷恋上了把自己带大，经常爱抚自己的姑姑阿玛然塔， 常常和她裸睡，爱抚亲吻，就差做爱了。当阿玛然塔终于醒悟并拒绝和他苟且时， 他追随父亲为自由党而战去了。不料又半途折回，因为听军中的自由党人说，人是可以和自己的姑姑结婚的。他回到马孔多镇，又像以前那样在姑姑模凌两可的态度中徘徊，最后遭到拒绝后，就常到母亲皮菈的下榻幽会女人，但还没有来得及结婚生子，就被保守党警察射杀，孤独流血，最后死在电影院门口，而那时，他的女人正在洒着橘香的浴缸和散着迷迭香叶的床边里等着他。射杀他的警察却比他还早死，因为就在警察开枪的那一霎那，一发不知哪来的子弹也射进了警察的脑袋。之后每一个经过警察尸体的的人都会开枪，那具尸体被枪杀了4百多次，马孔多镇到处回响着自由党万岁的呼声。 奥雷连若二世的另外十六个儿子都是不同的母亲，是因为当地人为了优生，愿意把女儿送到战争英雄的床上。 十六个儿子都像父亲一样有着说不出的孤独感。十六个都愿意到马孔多镇来住，但是当他们的父亲问为什么，他们却茫然地说，不知道，只是听说另外几个兄弟都这么做。 十六个儿子都在做礼拜时被牧师在额头上铭刻了烟灰十字架。十五个儿子最后在一日之间被保守党暗探射杀，子弹从额头的十字架上穿进脑袋瓜。第十六个是后来在布恩迪亚大院门前被射杀的， 当然那时后话。其中比较突出的一个，还完成了他的祖父阿卡迪一世创建冰厂的愿望， 只是没有把马孔多镇边城冰屋之城。 这个儿子同时也引进的铁道， 把清水河里躺着的无人过问的史前鹅卵石磨的吱吱惨叫， 把二十世纪的摩登带到闭塞落后的马孔多镇同时，也带来贪婪的外国资本，永远改变了马孔多镇。 第四代的布恩迪亚生长在战后变迁的年代，是从暴富走向衰败的一代。 虽然不像他们的父母一辈浴血奋战在持久而残酷的内战中， 却痛苦不堪地挣扎在传统文化与现代化的激烈的血战中。跟着外来资本一起暴富，同时也在被外来势力的掠夺和同化中，无所适从，输个精光。 火车带来了全世界各地的人。人们在马孔多镇建起了法国画廊和妓院，阿拉伯村，日本村， 土耳其街， 和美国香蕉公司。 外国佬破坏了马孔多镇原有的次序，荒淫无度地挥霍着马孔多镇的资源换来的易得之财， 原始的热带丛林变成了大片大片的香蕉园，土壤被改变了， 天气被改变了，就是马孔多原镇人难以改变。 长女Remedios the beauty －俏姑娘雷梅蒂娥丝是个旷世嫉俗的美人，是自由党暴君阿卡迪三世和美女珊塔索非亚的女儿，出生六个月后，父亲就被枪决了。父亲原来要她跟着高祖母叫乌苏拉，可高祖母说，叫这个名字的这个女人一生太多苦难了，还是叫Remedios雷梅蒂娥丝。俏姑娘身上有一种毒素，凡是爱上她的男人都会突然死掉，身上留下她的气味。四个这样的男人死后，就没有人敢来爱她了，虽然那些虚伪的男人总是说，能碰碰这样美女死而后快。她于是飘飘然生活在美人的孤独世界里，她喜欢裸体因为那样舒服，她天真清纯，毫不怀疑有居心叵测的人，却总能达到自己目的，为己所为，并引导时装新潮流。腐败的旧传统拘束不了她，毁灭性的现代化侵蚀不了她。就像她的祖伯父奥雷连若二世说的，其实她是最清醒的人，简直不是这个世界上的人。果真，有一天下午，她披着飘拂的白色被单，升天而去。 阿卡迪四世和奥雷连若四世是同卵双胞胎，生在父亲被枪决之后。两人小时候像得连母亲都无法辨认。少年时一个混血美女同时和兄弟俩上床，还以为他俩是同一个人。 阿卡迪四世小时侯目睹了一次枪决人犯，看到了被枪决的人被埋进土里还在微笑，于是他终身害怕被活埋。成年后的阿卡迪四世，长得像他的祖伯父战争英雄Colonel Aureliano奥雷连若二世，瘦削羞怯内向。却干起了斗鸡和教堂助理这些他的祖辈禁止和痛恨的行业来。因把性病传给情人，他被怒驱抛弃。 以后常常到镇上嫖妓，甚至学起腐败的牧师和驴子性交。他是布恩迪亚家族唯一的保守党人。 和他的祖先不一样，他没有什么想象力，唯有一次，他说要创造船业出了远门却带回了一艏拖船和一拨法国妓女，从此改变的马孔多镇的做爱传统，当然也给马孔多镇带来温文尔雅的法国艺术和生活品味。他后来到美国的香蕉公司当工头， 参加工人大罢工，却遭遇了大屠杀，他受伤后在装满死人里列车苏醒来时，发现屠杀者把正尸体扔到海里。回到镇上，所有的屠杀迹象已经没了， 镇的人也不知到有大屠杀这事儿，也不相信他三千多尸体被抛入海里的亲历说法。政府的书报里说没有大屠杀，罢工事件只有四个人意外死亡。 他回到布恩迪亚大院后，躲进了吉普赛先知Melquiades梅尔凯亚迪思 先前住的房子里，追捕他的警察眼光光地瞅着他，却看不见他。他知道先知的鬼魂在保护他，从此他躲在屋里攻读破解吉普赛先知留下的羊皮手稿，直到死去都不肯出门，破译也毫无收获。 他的母亲珊塔索非亚为了确保儿子不是被活埋， 就用厨刀割断他的喉咙才让他下葬。临终时，他的最后一句话是： 一定记住三千多尸体，全部被丢到海里。 （ 于此同时，他的孪生弟弟奥雷连若四世也死了。年轻时一夜暴富，放浪形骸， 年老时一败涂地，穷困潦倒。长大后奥雷连若四世，像他的祖父一样彪悍魁梧，外向冲动。小时候沉默内向聪明好学， 是他最先对关闭已久的吉普赛先知的房间好奇无比，高祖母乌苏拉打开那屋子后发现， 那屋子一尘不染，墨水不干， 桌上有吉普赛先知留下的羊皮手稿。 奥雷连若四世喜欢躲在房里，孜孜不倦的读书。喜得高祖母乌苏拉赞不绝口。不料长大后他却变了。爱上了手风琴，哪里热闹往哪钻。乌苏拉不由得失望叹气： 他们都一样都是不务正业的家伙。因为手风琴是没出息的弗兰西斯科那样卖唱的无业游民才用的低等乐器。 奥雷连若四世的妾Petro Cote原来是双胞胎哥哥的情人， 哥哥被怒驱后， 他倒是真的爱上这个女人，和他正式同居后，他的牲口疯狂繁殖，使他成了爆发富豪。于是他更加荒淫无度，花天酒地，日日宴乐不断。高祖母乌苏拉劝他不要挥霍，他索性用一箱钞票当壁纸，一边高唱弗朗西斯科的老歌，一边糊了布恩迪亚豪宅遍壁钞票。他在姐姐"最美女王"的加冕狂欢游行中遇见了另一个镇子来的绝世美女Fernanda菲兰妲后，一见钟情, 跋山涉水，不遗余力地寻觅追求。结婚后才发现这是个传统古板，傲慢无情，不可理喻的美女。 一个月后又和情人重修和好。 并说服妻子也相信他的财运来自于这个情人，牲口的疯狂繁殖是沾了她的福气。 从此这个心地善良，能和他同甘共苦的混血女人成了他的妾。香蕉公司罢工后，天竟然连续下了四年十一月零两天的雨，马孔多镇被毁了。他的牲口死光了， 他的财富耗光了。为了能让自己的一双儿女能到罗马和比利时读书，他不得不上街叫卖彩票，变卖祖地，最后得了喉癌（也是被嫉恨的妻子做法诅咒生病的）和自己的孪生兄弟同时死去。 高祖母乌苏拉说， 兄弟俩准是小时候易位了。因为家里男人名叫阿卡迪的应该是高大外向的而名叫奥雷连若的应该是瘦削内向的。而他们死的时候竟然又变的相像起来了，他们在埋葬的时候又一次被易位了。 奥雷连若四世的妻子Fernanda是个西班牙破落贵族的女儿，父母为了她的贵族教育耗尽家财。她的一生是孤独可悲的。小时候，父母把她当未来皇后那样抚养，送她到边远的修道院受教育，她信以为真，后来竟发现自己家道破落，现在不过卖哀悼花圈的人家的女儿。她变成了孤傲冷酷，成天想入非非不解人情的女人。嫁给了富豪，却得不到丈夫的爱，活的比小妾还要孤独。因为高祖母乌苏拉老了，婆婆珊塔索非亚又是极为低调，默默干活从不主事的女人。她变成了这个家的女主人。 她用极端腐败过时的传统治家，相夫教子，几乎到了不是人的地步。家里人人讨厌她，儿女反叛她。老的时候，儿女却在国外读书。自己只能在残破鬼屋里，炫耀儿女的风光，靠思念和写信过日子， 最后老死了也没有一个儿女在身边。作者在这个人物上用的笔墨最是犀利幽默，让人忍不住笑，忍不住骂，忍不住鄙视这个贵族美女。（这位虎妈是否似曾相识） 奥雷连若四世的妾却是一个善良，热情，极有耐心，和他情投意合，同甘共苦的女人。她是整本书中最不自私的女人。 老公穷苦潦倒时，以惊人的毅力帮助老公赚钱养家，老公死后， 竟然是她偷偷地赡养着老公的大老婆恨自己的菲兰妲，宁可自己饿着肚子，每日让人送一蓝紫食品给菲兰妲，并为了保全菲兰妲的自尊心，说是老公生前欠了债的朋友送的。第五代的布恩迪亚家族可以说是最自私最自暴自弃的一代。 但他们的苦难不亚于他们的祖先，他们简直就是挣扎痉挛在以他们父母为代表的腐旧的传统文化与毁坏性的现代化的炽热战争中。他们的爱情无比惨烈 老大阿卡迪五世性格相貌性格都像虚伪的贵族母亲。一生出来就被已过百岁失明却不服老的高高祖母乌苏拉抢去抚养，希望他变成大主教，拯救正在没落中的布恩迪亚家族。宗教狂的狂虎妈菲兰妲在他的床头摆了真人大，还穿着衣服的圣徒塑像，他的高高祖母用圣徒吓唬他，

可是却和四位少年同居。后来，他偶然在死去了的高高祖母乌苏拉床下发现了四麻袋金币。那是战争时陌生人留下的，被乌苏拉藏起来希望有朝一日有人来认领，任穷困潦倒的奥雷连若四世百般哄骗， 甚至挖破家园也都守口如瓶。 横财飞来，让阿卡迪五世和他老爹一样开始荒淫度日，最后被四位少年谋财害命，溺死在澡缸里，临死前还幻想着高祖姑姥阿玛然塔抚摸自己的情形。 老二Meme梅梅， 原名Renata Remedios在铁腕虎妈的严格管教下，成为了功课优秀的好学生。她被逼苦练中世纪时时兴现在却完全过时的击弦古钢琴，也成了有证书的弹奏者。表面上看似彬彬有礼，举止高雅。但骨子里却像父亲一样轻浮外向，爱热闹，爱派对，爱时髦，爱嚼舌。父亲在物质上对她百般宠爱，挥霍无度。名牌奢饰品满床满房。她很反叛地学抽烟，学喝酒。和美国公司阔佬的女孩交朋友后，学会了像职业运动员一样打羽毛球游泳，当然也学了英文。这使得他的父亲极为高兴，为她买了英文百科全书。却惹得排外传统的过时虎妈大皱眉。梅梅的初恋是美国去小镇度假的红发少年，暑假过后便不见了。她后来被一个总是有黄蝴蝶飞在周围的，有吉普赛人血统，香蕉公司的青年技工吸引，最初抗拒做爱的诱惑，

开始阿玛然塔乌苏拉拒绝，但是后来也禁不住陷入情网。两人在阿玛然塔乌苏拉的丈夫出门去弄飞机的时候，为了能随时随地随心所欲做爱，光裸隔世地生活在布恩迪亚大院里。后来当丈夫写信要回来时，阿玛然塔乌苏拉不得不告诉他真相。从此布恩迪亚的第六代男人和第五代女人便不可分离了。阿玛然塔乌苏拉生孩子的时候，流血不止，又发现孩子身上有猪尾巴一样的东西，他们并不知道那就是她们的高高祖母乌苏拉一世最恐惧的事，也不知道他俩之间真正的血缘关系。阿玛然塔乌苏拉血尽而死， 奥雷连耨六世痛苦不已冲到街上找安慰，回来时发现婴儿已经被红蚂蚁吃得只剩一层皱巴巴的皮。惊骇中他顿悟了吉普赛先知Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯留下的羊皮书稿的铭文" 第一代将被绑在大树上， 最后一代被蚂蚁吃了"。他急忙回去翻读羊皮书稿，这才理解了这是先知Malquiades 梅尔凯蒂斯预言的镇史族谱。 当他知道妻子 其实是自己的姨姨时，也明白了自己再也离不开这个屋子，一阵飓风刮来，扫平了马孔多镇连同布恩迪亚家族呜呼哀哉！英文笔记 读后感《One Hundred Years of Solitude 》forever singsong of the human tragedyMany years later as she finished reading "One Hundred Years of Solitude", Lynn was to remember that distance afternoon when her father astonished learning that she had just finished reading "The Dream of the Red Chamber". At that time, the massive culture revolution was on its peak all over in China, universities, colleges, high schools, middle and elementary schools including kindergarten were all closed. People only allowed to read the "red books" or some sort of revolutionary books. Reading of "The Dream of the Red Chamber" was definitely prohibited, even more so for a young girl of age of ten who presumably no immunity to the bad influences of the "feudal novel". "Why did you read this adult book? How did you manage to understand the words in the book?" Father asked in a delighted, proud yet disbelieve tone which inspiring Lynn in many of her difficult reading tasks ever since. "A dictionary and a good memory was just I need as you taught me before", Lynn answered casually， but confused by her father’s surprises as she had been in the bumping road of self-taught reading with any kind of book she could find after their home was raid by Chairman Mao’s Red Guards. "after all, it was not a difficult book to read. It is just a very sad story of a sentient stone and a reincarnated flower’s unfulfilled love in humanized experience, why should it be just an adult book? The protagonists were all around 12 year olds, not much older than me". It was many years later, had she read the book for hundreds of times more, did Lynn realize the depth and broadness of the great book. A single word "emptiness", made all dreams die, what a tragedy! It was that cold winter afternoon, when her IPad came to display the only two solitude words THE END on her IBook, Lynn was mesmerized into a silent she did not want to break, but to gaze at the dancing and burning clouds on the sun setting winter sky, as if the Buendia clan and Macondo were wiped out by the wind and exiled from the IPAD at the precise moment when those two big words appeared on her IBOOK; as if those more than a thousand iBook pages of solitude and tumult, birth and dead, love and hate, reality and fantasy, hope and desperation, prosperity and poverty, war and peace, liberal and conservative, nostalgia and amnesia were evaporating into the burning clouds, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on the earth. The burning clouds were dancing, emerging, and eventually magically transmuting into the very big word "SOLITUDE".      Solitudes were written all over the book, fearful solitude, terrible solitude, exasperated solitude, virginal solitude, simple solitude, serene solitude, blissed solitude, adolescence solitude, decrepitude solitude, death solitude…etc. Solitude is one of the main themes of One Hundred Years of Solitude as its title indicated. Buendia clan was trapped in the fictional town of Macondo surrounded by water on all sides, isolated and distance from the world. The town was built by the founding father Jose Arcadio Buendia 1G according to his dream. Since then, no matter how far they went away, wherever they had been, however they had fought, whatever glories or desperations they got, Buendias always end up a solitude soul die in or vanished with this isolated town.      It was in this impenetrable solitude air, generations of Buendias were repeatedly turning toward incest and self-indulgent: married their cousin or sister, fell in love with their aunts, desired the same women among brothers, rivaled love for the same man between sisters. They magically lived and communicated very well with ghosts, some even lived like a ghost in nostalgia or in empty memory, even names of the family were repeated in generations and were so limited just to Jose, Arcadio, Aureliano for males, Amaranta, Remedios, Ursula for females.       One Hundred Years of Solitude is such a sad song of the human tragedy. The lyrical notes not only resonated the weathered beauty, failure hero, pulverized utopian and fatal prophecy, but also echoed misery of seclusion life much bigger than Columbia and South American. The theoretical labyrinths between conservative and liberal, the deceptions of politics, the emptiness of war, the brute massacre and cover up, the corruptions of government, the alternation of the weather by rapacious of foreign capitalism, the human destructions of nature environment…etc., all of these have been happening over the world still. The historic significant content was so perfectly parallel in the mastery construction of the novel, as in his most beautiful, melancholy and reverberate first note: Many years later when faced the fire squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember in that distance afternoon his father took him to discover ice. Garcia had the past, present and future synchronized in one phrase, and then the rhythms continue on till the end of the book. "Years later" repeated 21 times in the book, not counting months later, weeks later. There were endless deaths in this book, mad dead, serene dead, silent dead, aged dead, mysterious dead, sudden dead, heavenly dead, "facing fire squad" was just one of the death and it was in its very first sentence to spell an instant sadness and violence. There were countless examples of the ordinary became extraordinary, magical fantasy became daily episode in the book, "discover ice" was just one of them which immediately blurred the normal boundary between ordinary and fantasy. The ordinary substance formed in nature and existed millions of years was exclaimed to be the biggest diamond in the world, and declared as "the greatest invention" by Jose Arcadia Buendia. It was that ICE, Jose Arcadia Buendia dreamed about – a town of houses with mirror walls, the "mirror" was the ICE, and the town of houses with ICE walls, how could it sustain the hot and humid Columbia weather, how can it not melted in the Banana fever。What a magic, the ENDING of Macondo was so skillfully embedded at the BEGINNING。It was with this challenging pace of the overlapping time and overflowing details made those solitude characters so alive not only in the book, but also around us, inside us, and live forever, just as "the dream of the red chamber", even All that's left is vast emptiness and a great void, the dream never ended. The notes by generationThe first generation of Buendia was the legendary generation with the "Original Sin". THe fictional town Macondo was an Utopian town. The Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula Iguaran was cousins and predicted to marry each other from their birth, but when they actually married, Ursula was warned and became obsessed with the fear of bearing a baby with pigtail as their incestuous Aunt and Uncle. Ursula refused to intercourse with Jose Arcadia Buendia by wearing a chastity every night in their first year of marriage. It becomes laughingstocks of the village and causing her husband to kill Prudencio Aguilar impulsively who insulted him in a cockpit fight. Hunted by the ghost of Prudencio and the weight of their own conscience, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his wife started their legendary adventures for an unprompted new land followed by some young followers in the village. After almost two years of long journey, Jose Arcadio Buendia had found the Macondo according his dream and had houses built on the bank of a river of clear water in such a design that from all of them one could reached the river in the equal distance, and draw water with same effort, and no house got more sun than another during the hot time. All inhabitants were young and happy under 30 years old and the town had no death. While Ursula had been working hard on her candy and bakery business to bring fortunes to the family, and had given births to the second generation of Buendia, the patriarch Jose Arcadio Buendia had been becoming mad in searching of scientific knowledge and obsessed in new inventions. Influenced by the gypsy prophet Melquiades who visited Macondo every year with his tribe bring in all kind of the new discovers and inventions, Jose Arcadio had been changing from most enterprising man ever in Macondo to a man with lazy appearance, alienated from any social activities even family responsibilities. He shut himself up in his laboratory, involved body and soul in all kind of inventions, including creating an imaginal time machine. Eventually he LOST THE SENSE OF TIME, and became mad in his isolated laboratory. He was tied to a giant chestnut tree for years until died in solitude when sky silently raining the tiny yellow flowers.  (Questions: Does the tragic ending of legendary Jose Arcadio Buendia somehow imply that the certain knowledge is essentially unattainable? As Garcia mentioned in the Book, Melquiades tribe had been wiped off the face of the earth, because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge) Ursula on the other hand was practical, severe without a bit of fantasy. She survived all her 3 children and adopted daughter, lived to more than 122 years old. Even granted with unbreakable nerves, extreme lucidity, unmatchable memory and clairvoyance, she was inevitably LOST SIGHT falling in to complete darkness with the impenetrable solitude of decrepitude, die alone, and buried quietly in an infant size coffin, very few people were at the funeral, because the people in town did not remember herThe youngest child of the second generation Amaranta 2G was a selfish, jealous, haughty and insecure virgin who’s heart became bitter permanently when her first love was humiliated and rejected by her adopted sister Rebeca’s fiancé when she was just a teenage. She spent her long solitude virginal life in hating her sister, she rejected desperate Italian lover who was the very same man she painfully loved and madly rivaled with her sister Rebaca, causing the man to commit suicide. She rejected her tenacious suitor Colonel Gerineldo Marquezs who was the best friend of her beloved brother Colonel Aureliano 2G for he loving her brother too much. She helped upbringing her nephew – her brother Colonel Aureliano’s baster son Aureliano 3G, and her elder brother Arcadia’s great grandson the Arcadio 5G, but committed involuntarily child molests by caressing boys with the way she should be caressing her lover. She planned to carry her implacable hates towards her sister Rebaca to death, but after 4 years of vicious cycle of weaving her own shroud during the day and unweaving during the night mediating and nurturing the undefeatable virginal solitude,  she became free of all bitterness and offed to take letters to the dead for people in town to make up for a life of meanness.The second generation (2G) of Buendia was born and grew up in the rising time of the family and Macondo. It was, if not a legendary generation like their parents, at least an extraordinary one. Two sons, one daughter and one adopted daughter, all of them had longevity except the elder son Jose Arcadio 2G.  Jose Arcadio 2G was a legendary adventurer even by today’s standard who traveled around the world 65 times and came back to Macondo only to die alone in mystery. He was born in his parent’s expedition time, inherited his father’s muscular physical appearance and impulsive character, equipped with unusual sized of male reproduction organ. He was seduced by a Card-Fortune-Reader Pilar Ternera when he was an adolescent and got her pregnant, but ran away with Gypsies for a crazy impulsive love. It was then he traveled with Caribbean pirates around the world for 65 times, he came back to the isolated Macondo with tattoos of different languages interweaved with blue and red inks on every inch of his skin. He seduced and married his adopted mud eating sister Rebeca, and therefore was exiled from the Buendias mansion by his own mother Ursula and led an isolated life in a house by a cemetery ever since. During the war, he saved his brother Colonel Aureliano 2G from the fire squad although no one knew about the intervention. He was found death mysteriously in LOSTING BLOOD which came out from his ear and flowed miles long, avoided any obstacles, found the path back to Buendia’s house on the floor of Ursula’s kitchen. They found no weapon nor wound on his body, nor was it possible to remove the smell of gun powder from the corpse even after many years later.  His wife lived to the old age in a hermit life till death. The second son Colonel Aureliano 2G was a heroic figure resembled South America’s famous revolutionary icon Che Guevara. He started 32 uprisings against conservative government with fighting footsteps all over Columbia and Caribbean coasts, yet he came back to Macondo to live through his solitude old age making gold fish for living. In contrast to his muscular brother, he was bony physically and had no trace of impulsiveness. He inherited the focus, enigmatic, clairvoyant, imaginary and artistic side of his father. He wept in his mother’s womb, born to have open eyes and premonitions. In his adolescence he was so much into the experiments in silverwork in his father’s laboratory that he silently developing a master skill of creating artistic objects out of silver. He later fell in love with a 12-year-old lily-colored skin and green eyes beauty Remedios, he started to write the love poems which were burn to ash later along with his war poems by his own hand, and determined to wait and wed her, at same time released his love anxieties by sleeping with Card-Fortune-Reader Pilar Ternera who was the very same woman his elder brother slept and had a son with (3G Arcadio). Again like his brother, Colonel Aureliano 2G had a bastard son, also named Aureliano (3G). He happily wed Remedios with the help of Pilar Ternera. The innocent, kindhearted teenage girl brought breath merriment to the Buendias’ house, but die shortly in sudden, poisoned by her own blood with a pair of twins crossed in her womb. After seeing the switching of the election ballots, and brutal killings of Conservative government soldiers in town, he became a Liberal and finally led a small group of rebels from Macondo to join the liberal army fighting against Conservative regime. While his military career had been growing more and more glorious that he became a Colonel, a General, and a Commander of rebel liberal army who was capable of anything, his heart was sinking deeper and deeper into bottomless emptiness and definite solitude. After signed armistice with Conservative government and unsuccessful suicide attempt, Colonel Aureliano 2G finally took a refuge back to his father’s laboratory. He concentrated in making and unmaking silver gold fish cyclically in pack of 17 each after all his 17 war sons hunted and killed by conservative government. He became a heartless old man incapable of love, LOSING MEMORY and silently die alone under the big chestnut tree that his mad father was tied to. (The third Generation of Buendia was wartime, tragic generation.  All of them killed young and all were illegitimate children of the family. Arcadio 3G was son of Jose Arcadio 2G and Card-Fortune-Reader Pilar Ternera whose identity was not allowed to be revealed. He grew up in ignorance and solitude among delirium grandfather, busy grandmother, love rivalries aunts, and hermetic uncle. Later he became the most brute Liberal dictator ruling Macondo briefly. Unaware the true relationship between Pilar Ternera and himself, young Arcadio 3G could not resist the obsession for his own mother as his father Jose Arcadio 2G and his uncle Colonel Aureliano did, he ruthlessly demanded to have sex with her. Frighten mother paid her life saving to have a beautiful virgin Santa Sophia to sleep with him. He married Santa Sophia later and had a daughter and a pair of twin boys born after he was executed when Liberals lost the war to the Conservatives. Unlike his half-brother Arcadio 3G, Aureliano 3G knew about his parents.He was born by Colonel Aureliano 2G and Pilar Ternera, and had been rising up by his aunt Amaranta and was caressed the way his aunt should caress her lover. He became obsessed with forbidden incest love to his Aunt. After rejected by Amaranta, he followed his father Colonel Aureliano 2G to fight in war, but desert and come back to Macondo intended to marry his own aunt believing some gossips about one can marry his own mother not to say his own aunt by Liberal believes. He was hunted and shut to death by conservative government police. The other 17 sons of Colonel Aureliano by different women, who was sent to sleep with most famous war warrior to improve the breeding according to local tradition, all had the same first name of Aureliano but carried their mother’s last name, all had solitude look as their father, all had cross ashes permanently marked at the forehead by a priest, and all shut at the ash in a single afternoon by secret agents of conservative government. One of the son, however, in his short life, did realized his mad grandfather’s dream, created an ICE production factory, built the railroad which was a direct descendent of the plans of his grandfather, and thus brought the Utopian Macondo to the modernity of 20th century along with the evil Imperia power represented by the Banana Company of America which devastated Macondo many years later.The fourth generation was the repetition of their grandparents’ in the forever changing Macondo, instead of fighting in the war between Conservative and Liberal as their grandparents, the generation had been tormented in the bloody battle between tradition and modernity, but lost miserably in nowhere. Remedios the Beauty 4G inherited her mother’s pure beauty, was born by Santa Sophia 5 months before her Liberal father Arcadia 3G was executed. She was a legendary yet poisoning beauty, men who desired her in any attempt would die in accident with her poisoning smell all over their body. Men aroused by her beauty but never love her to die for her, she was let alone wondering through the desert of solitude. She was not interesting in domestic happiness, nor did she aware of the sufferings around her. she was indifferent to any tradition and was immune to any modern fevers, she was not the creature of this world,  and one day, she silently ascended to the cloud. Remedios’ twin brothers were born after their father’s execution. By no surprise they were named Arcadio 4G and Aureliano 4G with the suffix Segundo. Despite they looked identical even their mother could not tell who is who, and the woman name Petra Cotes slept with them alternatively, thinking they were the same person, Jose Arcadio Segundo 4G grew to a bony adult like his grand uncle Colonel Aureliano 2G, and his twin brother Aureliano Segundo to a monumental size man as his grandfather Arcadio 2G. Arcadio Segundo 4G was obsessed in a fear of been buried alive after he had seen a man executed and buried when he still smiling. He was the only Conservative in Buendia’s family, made living on cock fight, and as an assistant of priest. He failed to create an enterprise of river ship line, but brought back the French prostitutes who transformed traditional methods of love making in Macondo. He later gave up his position as foreman in the American own banana company, took the side of the workers and joined the strikes took place in the town square in which more than three thousand workers were brutally murdered by government’s machine-gun firing. When he woke up on top of corpse in horror, he found that three thousand plus corpses were piped up as brunch of banana in the train cars and then transported to dump into sea like rejected bananas by government to cover up the massacre. He was the only striker survived the massacre and persistently preserved the memories and truths of the instance. All official records including school text proclaim only 4 killed and the worse over, the people in Macondo forget about it. He died without direct descendant, with last sentence: Always remember that they were more than three thousand and that they were thrown into the sea, at same moment that his twin brother Aureliano Segundo die. Aureliano Segundo 4G was the man of Buendia’s house at the time. He married a beautiful but rigid traditional woman Fernanda - the daughter of impoverished Spanish aristocrat who he pursued madly, and only to fell back to his loving, carefree, modern lover’s bed in just a month after their wedding. By sleeping with his lover Petro Code, his animal madly multiplied, he become so rich that he could wall papering Buendia’s mansion with one-peso bank notes. He financially sponsored his brother’s Boat making experiment and his Uncle Aureliano Trist’s Railroad expansion (one of Colonel Aureliano’s 17 sons). While he had indulged himself in endless parties, soaked in champagne and love of his concubine, his wife Fernanda had been reshaping the Buendia’s family into an out-of-place, inhuman traditions family with her icy-heart and iron-figs. Aureliano Segundo 4G died in poverty due to almost 5 years of ceaseless rain which ruined everything in Macondo and after he struggled with his concubine who had loved him in his good or bad time, to make just enough money to send his daughter and son to study abroad.The fifth generation was the most selfish, self-indulgent, abroad-study one. However, they suffered no less than their ancestors, they literally convulsed by the rigidity of their traditional mother, the ruthless of their profligate father, decrepitude of their great-great-grandmother Ursula 1G, bitterness of their old virgin great-grandaunt Amaranta 2G, hermit of their great-granduncle Colonel Aureliano 2G. At their time, Macondo was full of foreigners squandered their easy money out of local resource at the costs of forever changed environment, and locals were become poorer and poorer each day. The elder son Jose Arcadio 5G was rearing by a hundred twenty+ years old great-great-grandmother Ursula who scared him with Saint in the bedroom, but expected him to be a future Pop to save the Buendias from declining, he was bathing by his great-grandaunt Amaranta’s confusing caresses which became his sex fantasies till his last moment just like his granduncle Aureliano 3G. He was sent abroad to a seminary where he abandoned as soon as he reached Rome. He came back to Macondo to take care of his mother’s funeral, only then did he realized that the fabulous inheritance mentioned in his mother’s letter was a lie just like the legendary theology studying and papal future of his in the letter he wrote to her. He continued his promiscuous life with teenage boys in town and squandered the splendor fortunes left by strangers in the wartime decades ago, accidently found underneath his great-great-grandmother Ursula’s bed hidden from his unfortunate father Aureliano Segundo who exalted all means to find, but the sudden fortune also costed his young life, he was robbed and killed by same four teenagers he had slept with and knew about the secretes of the fortune. The second child, daughter Meme 5G was actually named Renata Remedios 5G as her mother Fenanda wanted to name her Renata and her Great-Great-Grandmother Ursula made the mind to name her Remedios, but every one call her Meme. She was a smart, pleasant, frivolous, outgoing and modem spirited girl, torn between her mother’s inflexible discipline and her father’s overindulgence, she was an outstanding student of all subjects especially in ancient musical instrument clavichord, on the other hand, she was a noisy party goer, often found in long session of gossiping, smoking, drinking with girlfriends, one time, she even brought 72 students to an overnight party in Buendia’s house. She befriended with daughter of American Banana company owner, and invited to privileged dance parties, swimming parties and became excellent swimmer, tennis player. She even learnt English, had first crash for a red headed American boy who after summer vacation disappeared forever. She then fell in love with a young mechanic engineer work in the Banana Company who always surrounded by yellow butterflies. Soon they became involved with irrepressible love making, even after discovered by her furious mother and imprisoned in Buendia’s house, she still found the way to have a sex with the man in her bath room for rebellion sake. They were discovered again by her mother, this time she arranged official guards to gun down the man who was coming to Meme’s bath room from the roof. He was paralyzed since then, and Meme was sent to a convert far away, and never speak a word ever since. She became old and died in convert as a Nun. A year later after Meme was sent away, a baby boy was sent in a basket to Buendia’s house, he was called Aureliano. The youngest daughter Amaranta Ursula 5G was born when her much older brother Jose Arcadio 5G and sister Meme 5G were the trouble teenagers and grew up in absence of them, but together with her nephew Aureliano 6G (Meme’s Bastard son, the 6th Generation, this was the most the most miserable generation who a single man bore one hundred years of sins and punishments of his ancesters) not knowing his true identity but as a living doll, and a boy found in a floating basket as told by her mother who was too shame for Meme’s failure to reveal the boy’s truth identity.  While they were direct victims of their parent’s self-indulge and inhumanity, they were having fun together in the devastated long raining time of Macondo, playing with waters, leaning math and reading encyclopedias together with their father/Grandfather Aureliano Segundo 4G, and discovering together the death of Ursula who obsessing in fear about having a baby with a tail of pig in Buendias through her entire life. When Amaranta Ursula went to private grade school and later had been studying abroad in Belgium, Aureliano 6G had kept imprisoning in Buendia’s house by his grandmother Fernanda (Amaranta Ursula’s mother), and had been learning and deciphering the parchment left in Melquiades’s room alone guided and protected by spirit of prophetic gypsy as his male ancestors.

At exactly same moment that he discovered his own identity and that he had married to his own aunt, he was wipe out by the wind along with the "mirror city" created by his ancestors。The sixth generation was most tragic and suffering one. The single man bore all the pain and punishments of the Buendia clanThe later generation of Buendias would not know that they were actually the repetition of their ancestors, their appearances, their life tracks, their characters and their fates were just the variation of Arcadio 1G and Ursula 1G, but gypsy prophet Melquiades and Poker Card fortune reader Pilar Ternera knew all.

She had been witnessing Buendias and Macondo from rise to fall, even had sex with the second generation of Buendias brothers, and gave the birth to third generation of Buendias.Notes by Chapter from paper note books   Chapter 1• Macondo town setting• Jose Arcadio’s obsession on scientific discovering and inventions• Gypsies annual visits• Friendship between Malquiades Jose Arcadio Buendia• Jose Arcadio’s Laboratory established• The childhood of second generation• The adventure led by Jose Arcadio Buendia to discover the communication path to outside world from Macondo• The death of Malquiades（ Chapter, the Creation of Macondo, the adventure, exploitation, and imagination） Chapter 2 • The marriage of Arcadio 1G and Ursula• The killing of Prudencio Aguilar•  • The adventure looking for the new land 2 years• The dream of Arcadio 1G and the settling at Macondo• Arcadio 2G Adolescence, seduced by Pilar Ternera – Card Reader, had sex and got her pregnant, ran away with Gypsies• Aureliano 2G childhood, shared sex fantasies with elder brother, lived with his father’s alchemic experiments• Amaranta was born• Ursula looked for her elder son and absented for 6 months, return with a group of people from other side of the swamp only two days away where the towns received mail once a month.
