赏赐的是袮，收取的也是袮。感恩……，感恩袮对我说话。和女儿珊珊一起去他出生地时，他三个半月，头是身体1/3大，脸像被人打了一拳，很平！鼻子很小！胡子很少，但耳毛很长……他闪着“我就是我，不一样的烟火……”的眼神，看着我们，大有不信任之感，绕过我们走……It was summer.  My daughter and I went to his birthplace. He was three and a half months old, a creamy colored, long-haired Persian kitten with a big head that was 1/3 his tiny body. His face was so flat like he had been smushed in the face. He had a small nose, short and disorderly arranged mustache, but long ear hair  ...... "I am different! So what!" He looked at us with a great sense of distrust, and walked away from us.按兽医的建议，刚进家门时，将他放在小环境会有安全感，于是他被放在浴室里。起初，它还是尾巴对着我们，满眼惊愕的神情：我妈咪在哪？According to what the vet suggested, a new kitten should be placed in a small space to feel at ease. He was huddled in the corner of the bathtub, his end toward to us and his head turned around, his huge eyes staring at us in disbelief:  "What do you want from me?", intermittently meowing quietly for his mother.珊珊小手轻拍他，细语安慰他...。他也顺服的依偎在她怀里，享受她的嘘声细语："不用担心，我懂，但都会过去滴，我们都爱你喔……"。My daughter craddled the kitten in her arms.  He didn't fight. Instead, he snuggled into her chest and accepted comfort："Don't worry. I know you miss your Mom. It will be ok.  We all love you....." 窝居里，被拥抱的日子很开心！起初，我们都紧锁住满腔热忱，让他好奇的本性趋缓他的恐惧，发现他的新世界，直到用鼻子嗅我们，确定无害的我们，肯首我们的触摸……，发出平安的咕噜咕噜(puuuuur……）声。不到俩日，他便以主人的姿态满屋窜了，表现出好奇无止尽的喵星人本像，我们成了一家。不过，他大概不懂他是被玩的吧，而以为我们是被他玩的哈！呵呵……。Everybody approached him slowly and petted him lovingly and eventually he started to have a soft purr.  It took less than two days, he was a happy kitten again!  We wanted nothing more than to squeeze him, play with him and coo over him ...  We passed him from hand to hand and he just melted into each person's arm.  他就是一团柔软的毛，柔软如丝的毛毛球！珊珊给他起名叫Fuzzy。Fuzzy的定义：满满的毛/发，不清不楚，糊塗，无清晰的说明或界限；引发愉悦或浪漫的情愫。He was like a mass of soft fur and got the name Fuzzy.Full definition of Fuzzy: covered with short hair, fur; not sharp or distinct; not clear in thought，lacking of clarity and definition; being, related to , or invoking pleasant and usually sentimental emotion.几个月后我爸爸来探亲时对华说，小英（我）为什么把世界上最难看的猫领回家了，又加了一句，千万別告诉小英。Fuzzy： 我真的很难看吗？ 只是很特别吧！？A few months later, my father visited us and saw Fuzzy, said to Hua : " Why Xiaoying (that is me), picked the world's ugliest cat to bring home", and then added, " Do not tell Xiaoying I said that". Fuzzy： “Really，Am I ugly?  Actually I am just unique!"哈哈哈……，其实，我，不在乎。从抱在手上那天起，他就是我最美的猫星人！感恩造物主！Fuzzy也不用卖萌，他的存在就是萌，就己完成了他被造的意义！因为他知道自己在世的角色。Ha ha ha ......actually, I did not care. From the first day I held Fuzzy in my arms, I melted. I know this appears cliche, but that was what happened to me. I lost every bone in my body at the moment when I first held him, my hands nearly swallowing him whole. Fuzzy is the most beautiful cat in my eyes!  Thanks to God! Fuzzy is such a cute creature!  His presence itself perfectly full-filled the significance of his creation!  Fuzzy led a charmed life!姐姐怎么揉都成……，一百个顺服！Fuzzy loved her and was fully submissive或许，姐姐的脸有更多的鼓励，接纳，稚气，给了他更多的安全感？Was it because she looked at him with encouragement, acceptance, purity and innocence that brought him comfort? Fuzzy：妳的鼻子也有点funny！Fuzzy: Your nose appears funny ！比起妈咪的游戏，姐姐的花样总是更多一些！呵呵……！Fuzzy和妈咪有"更丰富"的关系不是吗？妈咪要给他梳毛，要邦架他上汽车，而且和医生合伙压着他量体温，打针……！不过有比妈咪更惨的，老爹对他来说大该只是摆弄他屎盆子的那个存在吧? 而Pumpkin和Fuzzy的关系多是简单的相互取悦哈？Compared to Mom's games, sister's was always more fun and appealing.  Fuzzy would prance, would literally do flips to impress Pumpkin, with zero selfawareness.  I didn't feel jealous at all. Fuzzy and I had a complex relationship, one that involved bathing, brushings, veterinary visits and other unpleasant experiences. The relationship between Fuzzy and Pumkpkin was pure and innocent.  It was a good time and unaccompanied by responsibility. Fuzzy never liked car ride- he always presumes it means veterinary office. Fuzzy：别亲太长了，我要睡着了……Fuzzy: Do not kiss me too long, I need to sleep...Fuzzy：又照！有完没完？Fuzzy: Man! Picture again?!  Don't you get tired of it?  Fuzzy不喜欢家里有异常声音。若是我有哭出声的时候，他会跳到我身上，贴近我的脸，用异常洪量甚至嘶哑和快速的Meow，Meow……声让妳打住！ 我也实在不好意思和他比着哭。Fuzzy: 谁怕谁呀！Fuzzy didn't allow unusual sounds at home. Once I couldn't help but cry out. He jumped on me, moved his face close enough to touch mine with his whiskers, and shouted at my face with unusual loud and hoarse meows ...... The MEOW put me to silence at once.久而久之, Fuzzy or Fussy 对我们来说似乎都一样……. Over time, "Fuzzy" became interchangable with Fussy" (excessive and unnecessary concern about detail) which suited him just fine as well....“没心没肺”也扺不住Fuzzy的Fussy...Who can resist Fuzzy' fussiness?! Fuzzy好奇所有和水有关的设施，享受洗脸池里自我宝贝安全感，永不疲倦伸长脖子探究抽水马桶水声，竭尽全力抓住自来水的水柱……，喜欢各种不同的盛水器皿，只要不是商家为喵星人制造的饮水用器。这是谁的基因呢？！Fuzzy liked all water-related activities: cramming all four feet inside of a washbasin, sometime burying his head and tail at the bottom, exploring where the toilet water comes and goes, playing with the tap water, and prefering to drink out of any receptacle except his own actual water bowl... Fuzzy：这是我的！Fuzzy: This is mine !Fuzzy：放了水？！ 喝干它！Fuzzy：Who put water in here?  Fine! I will drink it up! 不到几个月，他长成成年身体，洗脸池装不下了……Within a few months, he grew quickly up to an adult cat and parts of him no longer could be contained. It took him a few months to reluctantly admit there was not enough room for his increased mass.  他想破脑袋也不会理解为什么就不那么舒服呢？Fuzzy对流水的好奇，一直维持到最后二，三个月，直到跳不上洗漱池为止。Poor Fuzzy! He wouldn't understand that at all and his curiosity for running water was not stopped until his last three months when he couldn't jump over the counter anymore.  一岁时侯，只好被迫接受为他准备的竹蓝子里睡觉……睡觉的时间也越来越长……Finally, he choiced to sleep in the basket..... and the sleeping hours increased as his age...在二个卧室的公寓里，那是我在兰莘的第一个，也是Fuzzy一生中第一个冬天。对Fuzzy来说，初雪很兴奋，但天天下雪很无聊吧！在窝居的日子里，他可能长时间的卧在那高橙上，风中片片雪花寂静的落在地上，是否曾飘走他的寂寞？……其实，我并不记得MI的第一个冬天或她的自然的春、夏、秋、冬。坚硬更适合那时我吧，不然孤冷如潮水满过，疼痛会抓住每个柔软的细胞和纤维，……。Fuzzy走进了我的冬天！他总是柔软，依存，活泼，重复、平常、却永不乏味的小东西……。Fuzzy：主银，我真是因为妳来到世上吧？主银：那个对主银永远是冬季的日子，你是我的小棉袄、止痛药……。Fuzzy： I am created for my person, life without my person is not full-filled...Mom: Thank you, my blanket and my painkiller!  You softened and warmed the frozen heart inside of me in this forever winter ... That was my first winter in Lansing and Fuzzy's first winter in life.It was a two bedroom apartment.  Fuzzy must have spent most of his time curled up on that high stool, maybe excited for the first day of snow and bored after that?In fact, my first year in MI, I didn't pay attention to the cycle of the four seasons as every season felt like winter to me--unspeakable pain and cold occupied my thoughts and tainted every fiber within me. That was when Fuzzy came into my life.  When the distances between me and the world was sizable, Fuzzy touched me every day. He would perch on the counter while I reviewed for my boards. When I thought life might overwhelm me...he sat on me and snuggled in my arms. His love was consistent and even raised to the next level for when I really needed it.  Every night since his first week, he would wait for me at the front door, staring at me as I opened it. Fuzzy' greeting made me feel better about life, about myself, and my safety at home. He made my heart sing, and filled the room with life , even on the darkest and coldest winter nights. 春天的的自由是可以上阳台上，但比起鸟儿的由自由自在，……唉！主银不在时，太无聊了！Here comes Spring!  Fuzzy enjoyed watching birds on the balcony in the morning, but got bored in the afternoon since there was nothing to chase with those twittering birds!  He would return to balcony near dinner time and anxiously waited for mom to get out of her car and call his name from the parking lot．成年猫的他，以为自己是master of house! 所以，主银请假复习考Board 的日子也需要早出晚归，因为，满屋都是Fuzzy的热忱，……。但是因为他，归，是一件令我渴望满足的事。Fuzzy： 我什么时候逗妳? Fuzzy: When would you like me to entertain you? My owner?  I never forgot to pet or hold him for a while before I turned my attention back to my homework.  Unsatisfied, he would climb on my desk and start sniffing ...Mom: "Oh, you just happened to sit on the paper I am working on right?  Must be a coincidence." Fuzzy: " That's right", Then he would push against thr pencil that I was holding until I put away my homework.  Mom:  "What am I going to do with you?" After my board exams, I might come home late but rarely brought any study from my work to home.Fuzzy ：好吧，我先自己玩。玩玩妳的植物。No more petting?  Well, I'll just entertain myself. Play with your plants although those are not my type, I prefer catnip. Fuzzy：玩玩妳的花，……不错，可以认为主银的东西就是我的东西。主银的餐桌是我的脚凳, 主银的卧房是我的寝宫,Fuzzy: Enjoy flowers, etc.  Thats right!  Everything in my Mom' s apartment belongs to me！Mom's table  is my footstool， Mom's bedroom is my bedroom．Fuzzy: 主银自制台灯罩下是我的优雅之处。Fuzzy: One of my favorite places is under the lampshade that my owner made for me! Fuzzy:主银的钢琴是我的战鼓Fuzzy: Mom's piano is perfect for my restless paws. Fuzzy： 对不起，偶尔妳不是我的全部。There was a time Fuzzy started acting strangely after I got home from work. He would quickly finish greeting and have a few bites of his food, then go down to the unfinished basement right away.  I changed his food, warmed his food, and petted him when he was eating....  Nope. He kept doing the same thing, headed down the basement, staying there forever....! One day, he ran a few steps, then stopped, waiting for me to follow. I reluctantly followed him to the empty, unfinished,filthy basement.  But he kept pacing back and forth, crying for me.   Finally Fuzzy led me to the middle of the basement where there was a " cluster" of gray thing. He meowed and walked around it. Placing my trembling hand over my mouth, I managed to breath, " Good boy!"  It was a dead mouse!  My hero!  Fuzzy:  I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you!  I did something for you!  I had to take care of this before mice invaded to your bedroom.  Mom: Good boy!  I petted him with a trembling hand and lifted him up and walked upstairs.   I didn't want him to touch that gray thing again!  No wonder he acted as there was a very important job waiting for him every day! Fuzzy：为什么没经过我同意，主人爱上了羊羊？Fuzzy: How could my Mom start to love lambs without my permission?!   Well, I was made to love what my mom loves. Fine! Will be cooperative! When he was young, Fuzzy was cautious with little  kids around.  He would slink away when they tried to pet him. But he was more patience when he turned 2 years old.  He would sit still tolerating the petting, even when his fur was messed up by the kids. We realize that Fuzzy's true love was people.  Once, Fuzzy followed a guest out of the house after a fellowship gathering, and was founded at 2:30am in the morning.  Since then, I tried to lock him up when I had fellowship meetings at home.  I could hear him scratching and howling: ". You don't have to do this, I won't do it again". It surprised me that how calm Fuzzy was around excited young people, sometimes more than 30 people. Fuzzy took it all in with his usual calm, didn't play favorites; and gave everybody a chance to pet him, he was downright mellow for strangers.  I am not naive. Not everybody is a cat lover. Fuzzy was just always waiting, there were always somebody to approach him with a delighted smile... After those meetings, Fuzzy would appear exhausted awaiting a gentle scratch on his chin that was a thank-you,  the one he would expect from me after waiting patiently in a crowded room the whole evening. 我想Fuzzy一定在睡前骂我：你这个话篓子！能放下电话，和妳的宝贝Fuzzy聊聊吗?Fuzzy: Soooo.... talkative!! would you remember I am here waiting?  Fuzzy：妳终于理我了？！其实，自从有了Fuzzy, 每天下班快到家时，主银有心跳加速的感觉……，渴望听到多变且丰富的Meow声。Fuzzy是早上必打召呼的那一位，而且是决不让你睡懒觉，从不掉链子的“闹钟”！！When I got home every night, Fuzzy would wait for me at the door and Meow at me. I would lift him up on my shoulders as routinely I did. He would sniff at me a few times to make sure I was the same Mom he knew.  If I didnt pay attention to him immediately, he would follow me to where I was headed and gave a louder meow with unusual length ....也是晚上必说“晚安”，且挤在你脖子上，让你无法“安”的那位……。甚至是这样的！三岁时他有了兄弟黑黑（五个月大）。面对黑黑，他拿出一副高贵、大气的姿势。看到黑黑兴奋的玩着小老鼠的玩具，更是不屑一顾。Fuzzy:  要玩，玩真的哈！当时黒黑虽然体重只有Fuzzy的2/3, 但耐不住青春期浑身使不完的活力，不断挑衅,使的Fuzzy不得不接召，也完全失去了矜持的姿态。When Fuzzy turn to three years old, we got him a younger brother named Heihei, five months old.   He was still a kitten. He would run maniacally through the house, knocking your precious stuff to the floor, and scratched furniture out of pure playfulness.黑黑的领地，从一楼的bathroom 逐渐发展到到了二楼主人的卧铺。Fuzzy 终于崩溃了，呕吐，不吃饭，体重下降……，X-ray 显示满肠子里都是气,医生说是stress。几个月后……黑黑长成成年，是从“奴隶到将军”，体重超过了Fuzzy, 腿比Fuzzy长一寸，反倒也学会了伸士风度，不再挑衅，并非常顺服哥！黑黑总是跟着Fuzzy后面作习，吃饭，睡觉……。因为，Fuzzy似乎成了黒黒的开路先峰，“Master of house ”总把主银该为哥俩做的事调度妥妥滴！Fuzzy: 姐姐在纽约NYU读书，后来在Cornell 学兽医，唉！不再只爱我一个，很少回来见面了。2015年，主银在家养病三个月，虽然是主银很痛苦的日子，但是Fuzzy最幸福的日子（除了早上那一个小时）。渐渐的，Fuzzy的活动越来越少了，终于停止了每晚饭后的磨拳擦掌，和在一楼30米射箭般的短跑（从bathroom到电视机）也越来越像兰主银！眉中有山川！Like father, like son. 老了，没力气反对别人的强吻！Too old to push away forced kisses, Fine! Fuzzy从小到大真是生了不少病， 也非常顽强Fuzzy suffered many illnesses but he was a trooper2003: Stenosis of nares             牙周炎 gingivitis.             关节炎 arthritis            高血钙 hypercalcemia7/18/2003: 手术鼻孔整形。Plastic surgery for correction of nares to open the nostrils. 住院二天2/172004: 肠激症 (irritable bowel syndrome, x-ray: GI full of gas)7/31/2004 体重 weight 10.30lbs2006:10/11/2008: 体重 weight 8.69 bls．2/4/2009: 牙周肿瘤穿孔急疹手术 gingivitis with perforated abscess10/24/2009: 体重 weight 8.75bls．5/6/2010: 外耳道细菌性感染 external ear infection.2012: 倒睫, 过敏, 鼻塞…… Allergy, stuffy nose...5/31/2013: 体重 weight 8.16lbs5/8/2015: 体重 weight 6.13lbs                  肝脏肿块 liver mass 10/2015: 便秘住院二天 constipation2/23/2016: 口腔肿瘤切除 resection of oral tumor3/24/2016: 口腔肿瘤复发切除 second resection of recurrent oral tumor4/25/2016: 口腔肿瘤复发…… recurrent oral tumor mass 5/27/2016:  体重从10.31降到6b l sWeights  10.31  dropped to 6 lbsFuzzy常常处于半睡半醒状态Fuzzy would intermittently open his eyes only a sliver, then out of tiredness, close them againFuzzy: 我并不想离妳而先去，但太累了，能让我走吗？主银：………………Fuzzy was so weak he barely could hold up his head, and he was trembling and shaking uncontrollably when he ate. He still tried to say hi whenever he saw I put down my stuff, or looked at him. He opened his mouth to meow but the sound was too weak to be heard.  Every day in his last month, Fuzzy would sit in the basket looking at me, slowly and sadly: I do not want to leave you behind, but I am exhausted, would you put your feeling aside? would you take a courageous stand for me?....This thought drove me crazy...One morning, I was holding Fuzzy in my arms, cradling him like a baby. He was just looking at me. His lip was trembling due to the pain even without chewing food.  I choked back my tears that burned at the back of my eyes and nose , put him back in the basket, walked out of the door and cried in my car all the way to my office.   I made a call to his Veterinarian who told me there was nothing they can do for his constant pain. Although I knew it, the conversation was crushing me, flattening me out, making me feel worn, deflated, tired....  Hua was in denial, he and I didn't want to talk about this. My daughter is a licensed veterinarian now and she was very helpful in preparing me for Fuzzy's time.  However afterwords, I only felt more anguish since I knew I had to make a decision by myself. The last thing I can do for Fuzzy is to let him die at home instead of at the hospital in a strange place. I had arranged Veterinarian who would offer us euthanasia  at home. It was May 27th, 2016. I couldn't explain to Fuzzy or say good-bye, I did my routine, acted nothing would  happen, just empty minded until the Veterinarian came. It was the only way I knew I could do it without feeling the full impact of emotional pain. The veterinarian and I walked to his resting place side by side. I determined to pet him like nothing out of ordinary was happening, but I couldn't hold back my tears. Fuzzy tried to open his eyes and meow to me,  immediately realized it was unusual and tried standing up...  The vet gave him an injection on the back of neck, within a few seconds he appeared weak and lay back down moving less, his eyes were open and his body just felt lifeless. This was followed closely the vet giving him the final injection.The Vet: " I will check for a heartbeat"I knew he was gone, his eyes were widely opened and fixed on me. I tried to close his eyes, I just couldn't see his face clearly because of tears... I agonized over my decision; mourned my loss and endured the physical pain that Memorial Day weekend. I had broken down in morning when I awoke,  in my office when I was not busy, on the way home where there was no greeting from Fuzzy any more, in the hall where the empty basket was... Not because I cannot rationalize what's right or wrong or cannot acknowledge the fact that Fuzzy was gone. I knew Fuzzy did not need to struggle any more. But it is still an uncontrollable emotion all over me..  Now I know how big a hole Fuzzy left.  You do love something more when it's been gone. Fuzzy火化后，骨灰装在一个小红木盒子里，留下了一个爪印磁砖。Fuzzy不应该是一个家俱，对我来说也不仅仅是一个动物而已。是他走进我生活，让我思想珍惜生活中的平常：那倾心，平安，温馨，温存，接纳，……。我不知道时间浪潮是否会模糊Fuzzy那不经意，踩在我心里的小脚印? Fuzzy可能是一个再平凡不过的波斯猫！对我，却是个不平凡的喵星人！ （喵星人定义：人们想像猫是来到地球的外星人，强调它有人的形象，但心知肚明它不是人）或许只是宁静之时，常常不经意的触摸到心底的小脚印，思念那肉乎乎小爪子，永远没有皱纹的脸，……我会短时任性一下让情绪的潮水冲散了理性的城墙。但终究我不相信剪不断，理还乱的逻辑，不想回避我对Fuzzy的思念，也生性不会轻漂漂的走过，不知为何痛，为何伤……。背对这浮华，喧嚣，奢糜的世界，别让里面的贫乏，干枯，或荒凉。没错，认真会痛，人可以选择走过忘过，期盼潇洒走一回，我想却有所不能。自然的人在时间里所能努力，是按着世界的荣耀一点一点的包裹自己，被世界亮瞎了眼，即不认识自己本像，甚至被自己欺骗……。我们会读不懂自己，也读不懂所珍爱的或最应该珍爱的。如今不再是我……，因祂应许万事效力，让爱祂的的得益处。We had Fuzzy cremated and he comes back to the house in a mahogany box with a clay paw print.  For me, Fuzzy is more than an animal! It was to do with love, peace, comfort, acceptance, a reminder of a simple joy in life he brought to me? He left prints in my heart for sure and will stay in my heart forever 天父：赏赐的是你，收取的也是你。……谢谢祢对我说话！My dear God, Thank you be my savior and my LORD that is enough for me to accept anything you allow happen in my life.  I pray you make me composed and accepting emotionally..... Human and animals, both made from dust and will return to dust. I understand that human has advantage of Jesus Christ the mediator of a new covenant.  Wouldn't a pet who had relationship with his owner be counted as one of his family?  How to understand Paul's teaching , "The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies"( Romans 8:19-20). You know I do believe in You and here is Your promise  "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household."( Act 16:31).How about your everlasting covenant,  "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth"(Gen 9: 12)One more here, you ask Adam to "rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground"( Gen 1:28). Would you give believers joy to bring their chosen pet along to new heaven?I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in your Words I put hope.   But I found nothing in your Words for sure that pets will go to heaven after earthly life. I pray and call on you, my LORD, give your ear to hear my prayer, list my many tears on your scroll, answer me with your whisper, hide me in the shadow of your wings.  Thank You for giving me Fuzzy for a while and you loved me through Fuzzy even when I didn't know you.  I wish I can do my thinking quickly, my heart  wouldn't weep and mourn any more.  Unexpectedly, I would break down over something that reminds me of Fuzzy.... It's painful,   Even so, I still want to say, YOU bought me to you by your precious blood, I am yours!  "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised"（Job 1:21). Death is not in charge. You, Almighty GOD, my heavenly Father is in charge!!  Death that stops this existence and finally bring true believers to  the LORD, is mercy from God.  For my dear Fuzzy, I am uncertain and still in thinking, however, I choose to rest in the truth that you possess infinite, perfect and inscrutable wisdom and knowledge as well as having abundant mercy and love! Ultimate sovereignty is yours!  You are my comforter! At least here you say that humans cannot foretell if pet will go to heaven in Ecclesiastes3:21. "Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?"Lord, I didn't forget and humbly remember, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law"(Deuteronomy29: 29).  I knew,  LORD. With your great power and outstretched arm, You made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and You give it to anyone You please. So, Lord you know I love you, but never love you enough, Only by your grace alone, would you give Fuzzy back to me when I am in heaven. You are on the throne and have made very thing new!   No eye has seen, no ear has heard and no mind has imagined. You only need to say it, so be it. Did I pray along Your line? If it's your will that Fuzzy is not with me in your new heaven and the new earth, in your kindness, you will take away my memories of Fuzzy. Because you promised that You "will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."(Revelation 21:4)."You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."(Revelation  4:11)We will humbly and gratefully live in awe of your glory forever! Thank you for speaking to me in my grief. 赛65:17 看哪，我造新天新地，从前的事不再被记念，也不再追想。"Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.……24 他们尚未求告，我就应允。正说话的时候，我就垂听。Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.25 豺狼必与羊羔同食，狮子必吃草与牛一样。尘土必作蛇的食物。在我圣山的遍处，这一切都不伤人不害物，这是耶和华说的。The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the Lord .罗8:18 我想现在的苦楚，若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.19 受造之物，切望等候神的众子显出来。The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.20 因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope21 但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享神儿女自由的荣耀。（享原文作入）that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.22 我们知道一切受造之物，一同叹息劳苦，直到如今。We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.23 不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的，也是自己心里叹息，等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。
