文字 // Justin Voitic攝影 // Kuna Lu | Kuna Photography GroupLuxury & Supercar Weekend rolled into the beautiful VanDusen Botanical Garden on September 12 and 13 to stage $200M+ of rare classics and modern supercars.As much as we hate to admit that Summer 2015 may have left us until next year, we got to cling onto that sweet summer glow with a heavy helping of luxury as we experienced some out-of-this-world vehicles, fabulous fall fashion shows, over a million dollars in jewels, bubbles, & caviar topped canapés at the Luxury & Supercar Weekend on Sunday.Two Felino models posing in front of the 2014 Felino CB7 – one of only 3 prototypes in the World, in matte grey, with only 10 in pre-production. Thanks to Antoine Bessette, the President of Felino Cars for meeting with us and sharing your vision.Billed as the annual luxury event showcases the crème de la crème in automotive design, yachts, fall fashion, jewelry, music, gourmet food, fine wine and premium spirits – The Luxury & Supercar Weekend did not disappoint.As always, Kuna Photography blew us all away with his vibrant, spectacular images which captured the opulence of all of his subjects. Kuna really knows how to capture a moment which makes us want to dive into the rich details. Visit www.kunaphotography.com for the 300+ pictures which go hand and hand with this article!We admired as we listened to some amazing restoration stories, some of these luxury supercars were just a shell and a basket and were restored over a decade with all the original parts, sometimes hunted down and sourced from all over the world. Thanks to Stephen from Autoform for all of his info on a 1962 Red Maseratti which won our hearts.I was dressed in a statement necklace & poncho by my stylist Raul Manriquez, an up and coming Fashion Designer from Calgary who has some exciting collections coming out in the near future- I will be interviewing him soon.This just has sexy written all over it! Felino’s 2014 CB7 is giving me Bat-mobile realness.We moved from the luxury hospitality tent for VIP attendees & media to the Catwalk to enjoy 3 different fashion shows put together by Oakridge & featuring shows by DKNY, Judith & Charles & Max Mara.The 70’s themed shows were fun with songs played by Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, I was coveting the looks I saw which featured black feathers, leather fringe, ripped – patched and distressed denim, DKNY faux fur vests, Doc Marten boots, Fall browns, greys, blacks paired with long flowing mermaid hair.It must be the Season of the Witch as everything was getting kinda Groovy! PS – We loved the Johnny Depp-esque male model who did his thing on the runway.The Luxury & Supercar Weekend is also known for showcasing Canada’s largest display of fine jewelry.  We passed two armed guards strapped with machine guns and handguns to enter a tent which contained millions of dollars worth of diamonds and fine jewelry in “The Vault” hosted by Luxury Promotions Inc.We were so inspired by Sophie Mizrahi-Rubel, the President of John Rubel – this jewelry company has a beautiful history and the company has been passed down to her through generations.She has reincorporated some of the classic John Rubel designs and upgraded them with a 2015 twist and was kind enough to take some of these pieces, priced at $700,000 each out of the glass cases for us as she told us more about John Rubel.Sophie even allowed me to wear one of her most precious pieces – a multi faceted ring with sapphires, which is a 2015 take on the multi coloured diamond cuff shown below, which is an original John Rubel piece of history and was breathtaking! 官網原文
